Assignment#2 

For assignment 2 I decided to work on the ATM machine program. 

The ATM machine has 5 options:
1.Deposit
2.Withdraw (with challenge)
3.Transfer Funds
4.Print Balance
5.Make a Payment

I am the only authour of the program (Filippo Romanelli)

The challenge I was able to solve was to output the least amount of bills when withdrawing money. 

Below I have placed the adress to the git repository as well as the javadoc:
